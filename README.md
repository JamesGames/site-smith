Site Smith
================
Site Smith is a static website generator programmed in Kotlin. Site Smith generates websites
based off of HTML and Markdown templates. I made it to primarily test out Kotlin, but I may
use it myself to generate future simple websites.

Site Smith is not done yet, the direction of how the project works
will probably change too.
